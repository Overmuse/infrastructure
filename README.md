# infrastructure
Mono-repo for all things infrastructure. This repository contains [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) files for constructing all the infrastructure that Overmuse needs to operate. The [`clusters`](./clusters) subdirectory includes the kubernetes manifest files and [flux](https://fluxcd.io/) configuration needed for launching and operating all of our apps, including configuration maps and secrets (encoded with [sealed-secrets](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets)). The `clusters` directory is the source-of-truth for anything running on out kubernetes clusters, and is up-to-date with whatever version of our applications running in production.
