# infrastructure
Mono-repo for all things infrastructure. This repository contains [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) files for constructing all the infrastructure that Overmuse needs to operate. The [`kubernetes`](./kubernetes) subdirectory includes the kubernetes manifest files needed for launching and operating all of our apps, including configuration maps and secrets (encoded with [sealed-secrets](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets)).

## Aspirational
The [`clusters`](./clusters) subdirectory includes files auto-generated by [`flux`](https://fluxcd.io/) and will serve as the source-of-truth for anything running on our kubernetes clusters. Flux will automatically monitor our container registry on AWS ECR and deploy new versions as they become available.
